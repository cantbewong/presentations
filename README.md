# EMC {code} Presentations

This repo is for all members of EMC {code} to have a home for the presentations we use at any conference or meetup. 

## Guidelines

1. Create a new folder with the title of your talk
2. Use [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/) as the preferred presentation software. Yes, you can expense it. If you use Google Presentations, create a new folder and within the README, link to your presentation but also provide a PDF version of it.
3. Try to keep personal information out of it. We know there's always an "About Me" slide, but try to minimize it if possible.
4. Commit all pictures used in the presentations. You can choose to use the GitHub Raw View link for the pictures or leave them within the folder. When using Deckset, do not use an entire tree structure for the image. For example, use `![](emccode-logo.png)` and not `![](/Users/kacole2/Desktop/mysweetpics/emccode-logo.png)`
5. Create a README.md file for each presentation to display on GitHub that gives the title of your talk and the premise. Mention what presentation software is used. It would also be helpful to update it for keeping a log of when and where it was presented.
